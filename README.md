# In-Kernel-Computing-OS-Caching

This was a miserable try to build a memcached kind of thing in the OS, for caching micro-second scale services until we found a paper that exactly does the same. But that's OK still we learned a lot about it. I don't remember what was the paper for now. I'll update the repo with the paper name later.
